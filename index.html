              <h3>The Day My Life Changed</h3>
              <p>
                I remember the first time I saw you at school.
                You were inside the classroom, teaching, looking shy yet so elegant. 
                I came up with a simple excuse just to speak to you and asked
                , “Which subject is this?” You smiled and said, “English.”
                I don’t think you realized then that I already knew the answer — I just wanted you to notice me.

              <h3>When ‘Us’ Began</h3>
              <p>
                Even though there was rejection at first, 
                I never felt like giving up. 
                I’m so thankful you gave me a chance to know you better. 
                When you finally accepted my Facebook request, our journey began. 
                Our conversations felt so natural, and we could both feel the connection. 
                We used to text until 2 a.m., not wanting the conversations to end.

              <p>
                I fell in love with your bubbly spirit, 
                your expressive eyes, your cute smile, 
                and the beautiful heart that makes you who you are. 
                I still remember the first time I saw you walking into the store, 
                your head covered with a scarf and your eyes shining. 
                You were the most beautiful girl I had ever seen in my life — you looked like a dream.

              <h3>December 3 — The Day You Became My Wife</h3>
              <p>
                The day we got married was not just the beginning of a new chapter; 
                it was the moment when two souls promised each other forever. 
                The way we got married felt almost historic, 
                and I truly loved every part of it. It was magical.

        <p>
On December 3, when you became my wife, it felt like the whole world paused for a moment — as if it knew my heart had finally found its home.

You are my warmth in silence,
my peace in chaos,
and my happiness even in distance.

I fell in love with your joyful laughter,
your expressive eyes,
and the pure, fearless way you love.
You complete me in every way.
Even when miles separate us, nothing can lessen what I feel for you.

I don’t just love you — I choose you.
Every day.
In every lifetime.

I may not always be very expressive, but my love for you is endless. I will always cherish you, treat you like a princess, and love you forever.

Forever yours,
Your Husband ❤️
