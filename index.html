                I remember seeing you first time in school. You were shy but

                Though there was rejection, but I did not feel like giving up , I
                am glad that you gave me a chance to get to know you more. Our first
                texts in messenger

                I fell in love with your bubbly spirit, your expressive eyes, your
                cute smile, and the beautiful heart that makes you who you are. I
                remember seeing you first time when you were entering inside the
                pasal. You were the most beautiful girl I ever saw in my life
